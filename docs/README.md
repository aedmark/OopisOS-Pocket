                    |__/  A Browser-Based OS Simulation
```

Welcome to OopisOS, a sophisticated OS simulation that runs entirely on your local machine. It's a self-contained, persistent world built on a foundation of privacy and exploration, featuring a rich command-line environment, a secure multi-user file system, and now, a suite of powerful, integrated AI tools. All user data is stored locally; your world remains your own.

## What's New in v4.6: Your AI Copilot

This release integrates a powerful and flexible AI toolkit directly into the OS core, making it your "Friendly Neighborhood LLM."

- **The Gemini Gateway**: The `gemini` command now supports local LLM providers like Ollama and LM Studio. You can chat with your own models or use the default cloud provider for sophisticated, tool-using AI assistance.
- **Smarter Analysis with Chidi**: The `chidi` AI librarian can now accept piped input, allowing you to create dynamic document sets for analysis using commands like `find`.
- **Creative Suite Expansion**: We've added a full `BASIC` IDE (`basic`) for retro programming and a personal journaling system (`log`).
- **True Portability as Standard**: Portability is now the default, enforced behavior. OopisOS is a completely self-contained application, perfect for running from a USB drive.

## Key Features Overview

OopisOS is more than just a terminal; it's a complete ecosystem.

#### Core Shell Experience

- **Advanced Terminal:** An interactive command-line with history, tab completion, and background processes (`&`).
- **Piping & Redirection:** Chain commands together with the pipe (`|`) or redirect output to files with `>` and `>>`.
- **Sequencing & Aliasing:** Execute multiple commands with `;` and create shortcuts for longer commands with `alias`.
- **Environment Variables:** Manage session-specific variables with `set`, `unset`, and `$VAR` expansion.

#### Multi-User Security Model

- **True Multi-User Environment:** Create users (`useradd`), groups (`groupadd`), and manage group memberships (`usermod -aG`).
- **Privilege Escalation:** Execute commands as the superuser with `sudo` and safely manage permissions with `visudo`.
- **Unix-like Permissions:** Use `chmod` with 3-digit octal modes (e.g., `755`) to control read, write, and execute permissions.
- **Ownership Control:** Change file ownership with `chown` and group ownership with `chgrp`.

#### Persistent File System & Applications

- **Hierarchical VFS:** A robust virtual file system powered by IndexedDB that persists between sessions.

- **File Management:** A comprehensive suite of commands including `ls`, `find`, `tree`, `diff`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `zip`, and `unzip`.

- **Application Suite:**

  - `gemini`: Your new AI copilot. Chat with local or cloud-based LLMs, and watch as it uses system tools to find answers.
  - `chidi`: An AI-powered document analysis tool to summarize and query your files.
  - `basic`: An integrated development environment for the classic BASIC programming language.
  - `log`: A secure, timestamped journaling application.
  - `edit`: A powerful, context-aware text editor with live Markdown preview as well as syntax highlighting.
  - `paint`: A character-based art studio for your inner artist.
  - `adventure`: A powerful, data-driven text adventure engine to play and build interactive fiction.

## Core Architectural Concepts

OopisOS is built on several foundational principles that ensure it is secure, modular, and persistent.

#### The Persistence Layer: A Self-Contained World

The entire state of OopisOS is stored locally and persistently on your machine, requiring no server interaction.

- **IndexedDB:** Provides the robust, transactional database needed to manage the entire hierarchical file system.
- **LocalStorage:** Acts as a faster key-value store for session-critical data like user credentials, command history, and aliases.

#### The Security Model: Control and Privacy

- **User Roles:** The system includes a "superuser" (`root`) with full privileges, alongside standard users who are subject to permission checks. The default `root` password is `mcgoopis`.
- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are not stored in plain text. They are securely hashed using the browser's Web Crypto API.
- **Permission System:** The `chmod` command implements the standard Unix-like octal permission model.

#### The Command Contract: Secure by Design

OopisOS has a highly modular command architecture. Adding a new command is a declarative process where you *declare* your command's requirements to the `CommandExecutor`, which enforces these rules *before* your command's core logic is ever run. This is a critical security and stability feature. The contract includes:

- `flagDefinitions`: All flags the command accepts.
- `argValidation`: The number of arguments your command expects.
- `pathValidation`: Which arguments are file paths and what type they should be.
- `permissionChecks`: Which permissions (`read`, `write`, `execute`) the user must have on those paths.

#### The Error Handling Golden Rule: Predictability and Clarity

To ensure stability and ease of debugging, all internal functions and commands that can fail adhere to a strict, unified error handling contract.

- **The Unified Error Object:** Every fallible function returns a consistent object shape.
  - **On Success:** `{ success: true, data: ... }`
  - **On Failure:** `{ success: false, error: "A descriptive message." }`
- **Centralized Logic:** A dedicated `ErrorHandler.js` module provides `ErrorHandler.createSuccess()` and `ErrorHandler.createError()` methods to ensure all parts of the system generate these objects consistently. This eliminates ambiguity and makes the entire codebase more predictable and resilient.

## For Developers: Contributing to OopisOS

The codebase is organized into modular files with clear responsibilities.

- `main.js`: Main entry point and bootloader.
- `commexec.js`: The Command Executor, which orchestrates the command lifecycle.
- `scripts/commands/registry.js`: The registry where all command modules register themselves.
- `scripts/commands/*.js`: Self-contained modules for each individual command.
- `fs_manager.js`: The gatekeeper for all Virtual File System operations and permission checks.
- `user_manager.js`: Handles all logic for users, groups, and authentication.
- `error_handler.js`: The central module for creating standardized success and error objects.

To add a new command, simply create a new file in `/scripts/commands/`, define the command's contract and logic using the standard pattern. The command will be loaded dynamically on first use.
